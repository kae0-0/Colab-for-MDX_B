It has similar functionality, besides volume compensation probably doesn't work for instrumental models main stems, and Demucs 2 for MDX vocal models is gone along with min/avg/max, but in return you got Deezer downloader inside the Colab, and maybe even YT links support, can't remember. Also, you can set manual model parameters for any new custom model parameter in future, or let it be loaded from json, matching to previously added models.
